Comments and results:

Briefly reflect on how this all went...
  + what value of k did you decide on for your kNN?
  + how smoothly did the kNN workflow go...
  + thoughts on this "machine learning pipeline" ?

    I accidentally mv the original file to digits4.csv instead cp-ing it (on the terminal), so the functions I are now gone :( 
    But it's alright since I remember my best_k, and I chose 9 because I had first had the best 2, 5, 7,9, 11 w/ 5 cv & then I increased it & it when between 7, 9, & 11, so I picked 9 at the end
    Then, I realized that it wasn't the 'best' as the first test case was never correct :( but then testing it with a large range of k (I had a function), it still was the same problem everytime, so ... didn't work out completely, so...
    I stayed w/ 9 as my best k. 
    I guess I learned that it's not good w/ oddities? and depends heavily on the test data 

Also, include the predicted labels of the 9 unlabeled irises!
  + Paste those labels -- or both data and labels -- here:
  + You'll have 9 lines:
  [1 2 1 1 0 0 2 1 0]
