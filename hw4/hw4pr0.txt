It would really define what 'naturally' means. While conversation and translation are related, they are also dissimilar in that one requires some creativity than the other. 
With translations, it still somewhat fits into computer diagram of input and 'expected' output; translations do little to change the meaning and the function is still the same. 
However, with conversations, it stands to wonder what kind of conversations one might refer to: would it be like a salesperson, customer service, or an intelligent conversation with a human being that is indistinguable from humans themselves?
While it is definitely true that being able to translate intelligently would lay the foundation, the path to the intelligent conversation about a random subject is not so direct.
